About the project
=================
BRKUT is a simple pong-type game against a destructible brick wall. The bricks have different strengths (hit points). The ball launch angle varies as a function of the contact point on the paddle. The game will feature oldskool lo-fi aesthetics: a square ball, limited amount of colours, 8-bit sounds and three-letter initials on the high score table.

TODO
